## Sites for Package Building Details
The following are some resources to consult when learning how to build a package:

- The site and documentation of the package maker (For example, if you want to make a Python package, you should refer to [python.org](https://python.org) for instructions on how to build and install it from scratch)
- [Beyond Linux From Scratch (A.K.A BLFS)](https://linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/)
- Search engines like [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
