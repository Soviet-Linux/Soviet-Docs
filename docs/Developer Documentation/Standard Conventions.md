## Sites to get details about how to build a package

The following are some sites that you should go and see how the install a package:

- The Site and documentation of the maker of the package that you make (For example, If you want to make a package about python you should look at [python.org](https://python.org) for how to build it and install it from scratch)
- [Beyond Linux From Scratch (A.K.A BLFS)](https://linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/)
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) or any other Search Engine For example, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
